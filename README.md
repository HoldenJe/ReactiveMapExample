# ReactiveMapExample
A toy model to explore features with mapview and shiny

## Goal
The goal of this example is to provide a reproducible example of a minimal Shiny app that can be modified to use the mode = "click" behaviour from selectFeatures.

I would like to acknowledge the authors of the following page that provided the base structure for my minimal example.
